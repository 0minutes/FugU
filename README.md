# Learning TypeScript by Creating a Programming Language

Welcome to my project, where I am learning TypeScript by creating a programming language from scratch. This hands-on approach helps me deepen my understanding of TypeScript, building on my existing JavaScript knowledge.

The source code for various components of the language can be found in the `./src/` directory.

## Project Structure

- [`./src/Lexer/Lexer.ts`](./src/Lexer/Lexer.ts) - Contains the lexer implementation.
- [`./main.ts`](./main.ts) - Contains the shell code which allows the language to be run in the console (when interpreter somewhat working ill add support).

## Progress

- [x] **Lexer** - Completed ([source](./src/Lexer/Lexer.ts))

**Stay tuned for updates as I continue to build and refine this programming language!**
